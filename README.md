## Introduction:
This is a [Discordia](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia) discord bot extension to help with voice receiving and handling.
The requirements are to be using [luvit](https://github.com/luvit/luvit) and [Discordia](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia).

## Installation:
1. Make sure you are in the root directory of your discordia bot.
2. Run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ta-noshii/discordia-voice.git ./deps/discordia-voice
```
3. Ensure the existence of the discordia-voice folder in your `deps` folder.
4. Require the module in your main script as such:
```lua
require("discordia-voice")
```
And you're done!

## Usage:
TODO, a few examples are listed [here](https://github.com/Ta-noshii/discordia-voice/tree/master/examples).
