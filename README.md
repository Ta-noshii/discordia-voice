## Introduction:
This is a [Discordia](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia) discord bot extension that introduces *Voice Receiving* and extended functionality for *Voice Calls*.
The requirements to use this extension are [luvit](https://github.com/luvit/luvit) and [Discordia](https://github.com/SinisterRectus/Discordia).

## Installation:
1. Make sure you are in the root directory of your discordia bot using `cd`.
2. Run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ta-noshii/discordia-voice-plus.git ./deps/discordia-voice-plus
```
3. Ensure the existence of the discordia-voice-plus folder in your `deps` folder.
4. Require the module in your main script as such:

And you're done!
